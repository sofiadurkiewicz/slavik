<h2>The Slavik Word: Our Mission</h2>
<p>
  The waves of economic migration of East and South Europeans to the Western Europe and the US had contributed to the loss of positive public opinion on our community.
  More recently, the perception of East and South Europeans has significantly been downgraded as a result of UK's decision to leave European Union.
  Our aim is to champion the success and talent that those countries produce. Too often, our success stories have been ignored or have gone unnoticed by the wider international community.
